A tech nerd out of Tampa Bay, I'm interested in engineering effective and endruring IT solutions in a complex and dynamic industry; with a B.S. in Network Engineering from Purdue University, previously Cisco Networks certified, and earnest working experience both as a member of a specialized team with rigid policies, as well as a less structured team where I had more opportunities to design solutions myself and make meaningful contributions to other teams.

I like to spend my free time researching new innovations in tech and working on personal projects to keep my skills sharp, as well as spending time with friends and family, exercising, being outdoors, and playing sports and video games.

Check out the Blog and Projects tab above for some interesting and informative write-ups on various technical concepts and implementations.
