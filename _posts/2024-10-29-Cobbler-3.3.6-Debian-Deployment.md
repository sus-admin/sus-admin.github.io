title: Cobbler (v3.3.6) Debian Deployment Guide
author: Sus-Admin
summary: Deploying Debian Bullseye and Bookworm (11 & 12) via PXE network boot.
tags: cobbler
---

This guide assumes that you have read the [Cobbler 3.3.6 Beginner's guide](/_post/2024-10-16-Cobbler-3.3.6-Beginners-Guide.md) and have a Fedora 34 server or workstation configured to run Cobbler v3.3.6 server as described in that guide. It is not necessary to *deploy* the Fedora 34 or 37 PXE client as described in the Beginner's Guide, but it is recommended for new users, as Cobbler is geared towards Red Hat Linux distros like Fedora.

## Objective

Starting off where the [Beginner's guide](/_post/2024-10-16-Cobbler-3.3.6-Beginners-Guide.md) left off, we will use the same system and network environment, and further configure the Cobbler v3.3.6 server to deploy the latest release of Debian 11 Bullseye and Debian 12 Bookworm via PXE network boot. This guide assumes you still have `selinux` and `firewalld` configured and enabled as described in the Beginner's guide, but you may find it helpful to disable those services during initial testing of the new Debian deployments.

### Caveats

- using the `cobbler check` CLI command on the Cobbler server, you should notice that it recommends installing the `debmirror` package in order to manage Debian deployments and repos with Cobbler. Instead, we will simply import the Debian source installation media (.iso file), which will become available over HTTP, and use that as the local repo mirror to install over the network.

    - This method is not the Cobbler official method, and Debian actually [recommends](https://www.debian.org/mirror/ftpmirror) using something like "apt-cacher-ng" or "squid proxy" instead of "debmirror"

- There is an issue I encountered with installing Debian 11 & 12 over the network where the PXE client (`debian-installer`) does not trust the installation source (repo mirror) which this guide provides a workaround to.

    - Several issues were encounted in this endeavor, but this one appears to be a bug in the `debian-installer` (`d-i`); more info provided in the **Tips & Troubleshooting** section below.
	
    - Debian's official [stable](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/example-preseed.txt) and [bookworm](https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/example-preseed.txt) example preseeds mention the `debian-installer` [source code](https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/apt-setup/-/blob/master/generators/60local?ref_type=heads) in the same configuration section where I found the bug, so I took a look for myself and did not see the logic for using the `d-i apt-setup/local0/key` preseed value either by specifying a URL or a base64 encoded value, which I am probably just missing something there, but I do believe it is some kind of bug with the `debian-installer`.

## Cobbler Server Prep

Debian maintainers advise that network booting Debian is [not for novice users](https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst#netboot), and they're not wrong, but we are no amateur.

That said, continue at your own risk.

### Dependencies

Download the latest releases of Debian Bookworm and Bullseye

```shell
cd ~/Downloads && wget https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-dvd/debian-12.7.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso
cd ~/Downloads && wget https://cdimage.debian.org/mirror/cdimage/archive/11.11.0/amd64/iso-dvd/debian-11.11.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso
```

additionally, all Debian releases at the time of writing require the "netboot" initial ramdisk (`initrd`) provided separately by the Debian maintainers in order to properly boot over the network. Furthermore, Debian 11 Bullseye and earlier require the "netboot firmware" image, also provided by Debian, which is an extension to the netboot `initrd`. More on this in the **Tips & Troubleshooting** section below.

```shell
wget -O ~/Downloads/Debian12.7-netboot.gz https://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/debian-installer/amd64/initrd.gz

wget -O ~/Downloads/Debian11.11-netboot.gz  https://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/bullseye/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/debian-installer/amd64/initrd.gz
wget -O ~/Downloads/Debian11.11-firmware.gz https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/firmware/bullseye/current/firmware.cpio.gz
```

> The netboot `initrd.gz` file above is not maintained to the same degree of the main Debian installation media; only the netboot `initrd.gz` image corresponding to the LATEST official release of Debian for any major version (bookworm, bullseye, etc...) will be available on the official [FTP](https://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/) site above, and not the [cdimage](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current) repo or [archive](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/) where the .iso images are acquired from.
> 
> all previous releases of the netboot `firmware.cpio.gz` image ARE available on the official [cdimage archive](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/firmware/bullseye/) at the time of writing.
>
> newer releases of the netboot `initrd.gz` and firmware images will not be compatible with previous releases of Debian, as they use different kernel and module versions.
>
> netboot `initrd.gz` image for previous releases of Debian CAN be found on the Debian repo [snapshot archive](https://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/), but you will have to determine the appropriate version to download based on the release date or timeframe of the desired Debian release, and find a corresponding dated snapshot to download the `initrd.gz` image from.

Create a GPG key to sign the local Debian repo mirror.

```shell
gpg --full-gen-key --batch <(echo "Key-Type: 1"; \
                             echo "Key-Length: 4096"; \
                             echo "Subkey-Type: 1"; \
                             echo "Subkey-Length: 4096"; \
                             echo "Expire-Date: 0"; \
                             echo "Name-Real: cobbler"; \
                             echo "Name-Email: cobbler@fedora.local"; \
                             echo "%no-protection"; )
```

> for simplicity, this GPG key will not be password protected. This is against cyber-security best practices and should only be implemented in a test environment.

copy the GPG public key to the public HTTP share on the Cobbler server and restore the SELinux labels

```shell
gpg --output /var/www/cobbler/pub/cobbler.gpg.asc --armor --export cobbler
sudo restorecon -R /var/www/cobbler/pub
```

## Debian 12 Bookworm PXE Deployment

mount the Debian 12 Bookworm installation media and import the distro into cobbler:

```shell
[ -e /mnt/Debian ] || mkdir /mnt/Debian
mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro /home/fedora/Downloads/debian-12.7.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso /mnt/Debian
cobbler import --name Debian12.7 --path /mnt/Debian
```

Navigate to the imported distro mirror and sign the repo:

```shell
cd /var/www/cobbler/distro_mirror/Debian12.7/dists/bookworm
gpg -u cobbler -bao Release.gpg Release
gpg -u cobbler --clear-sign --output InRelease Release
```

Concatenate the two `initrd.gz` images in the following order:

```shell
cat /var/www/cobbler/distro_mirror/Debian12.7/install.amd/initrd.gz ~/Downloads/Debian12.7-netboot.gz > /var/www/cobbler/pub/Debian12.7-netboot.gz
```

Configure the new Cobbler Distro to use the combined `initrd.gz` image:

```shell
cobbler distro edit --name Debian12.7-x86_64 --initrd "/var/www/cobbler/pub/Debian12.7-netboot.gz"
```

Create a new "preseed" (autoinstall) template from the sample included with Cobbler, and make the necessary changes to install from an unofficial source.

```shell
cp /var/lib/cobbler/templates/sample.seed /var/lib/cobbler/templates/bookworm-sample.seed
sed -i 's,# d-i debian-installer/allow_unauthenticated boolean true,d-i debian-installer/allow_unauthenticated boolean true,' /var/lib/cobbler/templates/bookworm-sample.seed
sed -i 's,# d-i apt-setup/local0/key string http://local.server/key,d-i apt-setup/local0/key string http://10.0.0.10/cblr/pub/cobbler.gpg.asc,' /var/lib/cobbler/templates/bookworm-sample.seed
```

> This is where the bug mentioned in the **Caveats** section above is introduced. The `apt-setup/local0/key` preseed value *should* allow us to provide the `debian-installer` with a GPG key, either available over HTTP or base64 encoded and set directly in the preseed file, to use to validate the installation source.
> 
> We will confugre it to retrieve the key over HTTP anyway, just in case (and we can see in the logs of the resulting system that there was a problem downloading, which is why I think there is a bug, as my workaround below will use the SAME command found in the logs which fails).

Create the script which will run on the PXE client to circumvent the bug mentioned in the **Caveats** section above (copy/paste the following block in-whole):

```shell
cat << EOF > /var/lib/cobbler/scripts/preseed_early_workaround
#!/bin/sh
while true; do
	[ -d /target/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d ] && cd /target/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d && fetch-url http://10.0.0.10/cblr/pub/cobbler.gpg.asc cobbler.gpg.asc && exit;
	echo nope;
	sleep 1;
done 2> /dev/null 1> /dev/null &
EOF
```

optionally, create another preseed script to run in the post-installation stage which will grant sudo privileges to the "debian" user (probably achievable through other preseed settings too...), and reconfigure the installed system to use Debian's official APT sources instead of our local Cobbler server.

```shell
cat << EOF > /var/lib/cobbler/scripts/preseed_late_sudo_sources
#!/bin/sh
sed -i 's,#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password,PermitRootLogin no,' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
usermod -aG sudo debian
sed -i 's,^,#,' /etc/apt/sources.list
echo 'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main non-free-firmware non-free contrib' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo 'deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main non-free-firmware non-free contrib' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo 'deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security main non-free-firmware non-free contrib' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo 'deb-src http://security.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security main non-free-firmware non-free contrib' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo 'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main non-free-firmware non-free contrib' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo 'deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main non-free-firmware non-free contrib' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
EOF
```

Modify the new preseed (autoinstall) template to install desired packages only, setup an additional admin user "debian", set the workaround script created above to run in the "early" installation stage, and the "preseed_late" script to run in the late stage, if configured, and more aggressively force the installation regardless of any existing installations.

```shell
sed -i 's,ntp ssh wget,wget curl openssh-server sudo vim\npopularity-contest popularity-contest/participate boolean false,' /var/lib/cobbler/templates/bookworm-sample.seed
sed -i 's,# d-i apt-setup/services-select multiselect security,d-i apt-setup/services-select multiselect,' /var/lib/cobbler/templates/bookworm-sample.seed
sed -i 's,d-i partman-auto/method string lvm,d-i partman-efi/non_efi_system boolean true\nd-i partman-auto/method string lvm,' /var/lib/cobbler/templates/bookworm-sample.seed
sed -i 's,d-i grub-installer/bootdev string default,d-i grub-installer/bootdev string default\nd-i grub-installer/with_other_os boolean true\nd-i grub-installer/force-efi-extra-removable boolean false\nd-i grub-installer/enable_os_prober_otheros_yes boolean false\nd-i grub-installer/enable_os_prober_otheros_no boolean true,' /var/lib/cobbler/templates/bookworm-sample.seed
sed -i 's,d-i passwd/make-user boolean false,d-i passwd/make-user boolean true\nd-i passwd/user-fullname string Debian Admin\nd-i passwd/username string debian\nd-i passwd/user-password-crypted password $default_password_crypted,' /var/lib/cobbler/templates/bookworm-sample.seed
sed -i 's,script=preseed_early_default,script=preseed_early_workaround,' /var/lib/cobbler/templates/bookworm-sample.seed
sed -i 's,script=preseed_late_default,script=preseed_late_sudo_sources,' /var/lib/cobbler/templates/bookworm-sample.seed
```

Configure the Cobbler Profile to use the new autoinstall (preseed) template:

```shell
cobbler profile edit --name Debian12.7-x86_64 --autoinstall 'bookworm-sample.seed'
```

> At this point, you may run the following commands on the Cobbler server, then start the **PXE Client** VM to test a manual installation over PXE.
> 
> ```shell
> systemctl restart cobblerd
> cobbler sync
> ``` 

Create a new Cobbler System to PXE boot and automatically install Debian 12 Bookworm, replacing the *"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"* with the MAC address of your PXE client, and making sure not to use a duplicate MAC or IP addresse of any other Cobbler System.

```shell
cobbler system add --name "Debian12.7" --profile Debian12.7-x86_64 --hostname "debian12-7" --mac-address "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" --netboot-enabled true --ip-address "10.0.0.12" --netmask "255.255.255.0" --gateway "10.0.0.1" --name-servers "10.0.0.1 1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8"
```

Finally, restart and sync up Cobbler:

```shell
systemctl restart cobblerd && sleep 10
cobbler sync
```

The **PXE Client** VM can now be powered on, and should automatically boot to PXE and install Debian 12.7 to the VM HDD using the "bookworm-sample.seed" preseed template created above.

## Debian 11 Bullseye PXE Deployment

Take similar steps as above, with the inclusion of the netboot "firmware" image file in the combined `initrd.gz` image file, and using the "bookworm-sample.seed" template created above as a starting point and trimming off a few unsupported preseed settings to import and automatically deploy Debian 11 Bullseye over PXE.

```shell
[ -e /mnt/Debian ] || mkdir /mnt/Debian
mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro /home/fedora/Downloads/debian-11.11.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso /mnt/Debian
cobbler import --name=Debian11.11 --path=/mnt/Debian

cd /var/www/cobbler/distro_mirror/Debian11.11/dists/bullseye
gpg -u cobbler -bao Release.gpg Release
gpg -u cobbler --clear-sign --output InRelease Release

cat /var/www/cobbler/distro_mirror/Debian11.11/install.amd/initrd.gz ~/Downloads/Debian11.11-netboot.gz ~/Downloads/Debian11.11-firmware.gz > /var/www/cobbler/pub/Debian11.11-netboot.gz
cobbler distro edit --name Debian11.11-x86_64 --initrd "/var/www/cobbler/pub/Debian11.11-netboot.gz"

grep -v "os_prober" /var/lib/cobbler/templates/bookworm-sample.seed > /var/lib/cobbler/templates/bullseye-sample.seed
cobbler profile edit --name Debian11.11-x86_64 --autoinstall bullseye-sample.seed

cobbler system add --name Debian11.11 --profile Debian11.11-x86_64 --mac-address "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" --netboot-enabled true

systemctl restart cobblerd
sleep 5
cobbler sync
```
